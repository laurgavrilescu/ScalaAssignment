## Scala assignment

The project contains some helpers for the code assignment you will get in the interview round. 
It consists of:
- a domain package where you can add your classes
- a test package where you can add your tests
- an entrypoint where you can also test your code in [src/main/scala/entrypoint/Main](src/main/scala/entrypoint/Main.scala)
- a dummy implementation of a Divider that use all above-mentioned pieces (domain, tests, entrypoints).
